/*
 * We find it important to know whether the libusbx backend ends up copying or mapping
 * our transaction data when it's submitted. On Linux, the kernel must already do a copy
 * to get our userspace data into kernel space. On Windows and Mac OS, the user buffer
 * is mapped. This matters because any changes to the buffer while a transfer is queued
 * will cause the transfer to change. This causes tearing for us.
 *
 * We can avoid this by copying the buffer ourselves, but we'd prefer to avoid the CPU
 * overhead of copying the buffer twice, so we only do this on platforms where the kernel
 * isn't already copying it.
